# Quick-Git ðŸš€
Quick-Git is a simple command-line tool that allows you to easily add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with just one command. No more typing out multiple git commands every timeâ€”just one and done!

## Features
- Add, commit, and push in one swift command.
- Works system-wide once installed.
- Saves you time and keystrokes on every commit. ðŸ™Œ

## Prerequisites
- Git installed on your system.
- Python 3 installed **(check by running python3 --version)**.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone over the respository to your desktop

        git clone https://github.com/your-username/quick-git.git

Make sure to change **your-username** with your actual Github username. 

2. Move the Script to Your PATH: From inside the cloned repository directory, run:

        sudo mv quick_git.py /usr/local/bin/quick-git

3. Make the Script Executable::

        chmod +x /usr/local/bin/quick-git

## Usage
Simply run:

        quick-git "Your commit message here"

This will:

- Add all your changes (git add .)
- Commit with the provided commit message
- Push the changes to your current branchâ€™s remote repository

### Example:

        quick-git "Fix bug in user login flow"

## Troubleshooting & Tips
- If you get a command not found error, ensure that /usr/local/bin is on your PATH. Typically it is by default on macOS.
- Make sure you have an initialized git repository (git init) and a remote set up (git remote add origin <URL>).
- If you prefer a shorter name or alias, you can rename or alias the script:

        alias qg='quick-git'

Then just run:
        
        qg "Short and sweet commit message"
