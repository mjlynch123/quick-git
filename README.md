# Quick-Git

This app allows users to easily add, commit, and push all with just one command.

## How to use:
1. Clone over the respository to your desktop
2. Open recently cloned 'quick-get' file in your terminal.
3. Type the following commands

        sudo mv /path/to/quick_git.py /usr/local/bin/quick-git

- Make sure script is executable:

        chmod +x /usr/local/bin/quick-git

- Now it is good to go system wide, you just have to type this to run the script:

        quick-git "Commit Message"
